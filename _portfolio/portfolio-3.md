This project explores the use of TD3 to train a quadruped robot, named SpotDog, in a PyBullet simulation environment. A digital twin framework is developed to synchronize and model the robot's physical behavior in real time, facilitating sim-to-real transfer. The research aims to achieve stable and efficient locomotion by combining learning-based control with a dynamic digital representation of the robot.
